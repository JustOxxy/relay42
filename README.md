## Introduction and Context

As Earth’s coffee supply dwindles and the lure of Martian sunsets grows, humanity sets its sights
on Mars—not just to visit, but to stay. This grand plan requires more than old-school gadgets; it
needs groundbreaking innovation. Relay42 is stepping up with the "Journey Orchestrator,"
designed to seamlessly manage the chaos of setting up shop on another planet. This platform
aims to streamline the complex coordination of interplanetary travel, ensuring that every aspect of
mission planning and execution is meticulously organized and monitored. Your task is to develop
this comprehensive system, incorporating real-time data handling, user interactions, and dynamic
content.
